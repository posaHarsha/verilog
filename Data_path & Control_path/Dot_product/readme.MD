This code is to solve the Dot product of 2 vectors of length 10 using only one Multiplier and One Adder.
In other words calculating the result of x0*h0 + x1*h1 + x2*h2 ...... x9*h9 using only one Multiplier and an Adder.
One, can also change the testbench and can solve for much bigger length of vectors.
we have Used the datapath and controlpath here, the Datapath and controlpath are in same Code unlike writing both of them in different files.
