Contains Registers one is 4x32 register capable reading two values and writing one value at each edge of the clock cycle(Like the MIPS)
.Prefarbly don't read and write the same address at each clock edge cycle.
.In synchronous with the clock.
and also the second one is the 32 x 32 bit register which has the same properties as the above
